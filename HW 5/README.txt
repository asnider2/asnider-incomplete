too many (thank you for your patience)

Suppose that you were sorting records (i.e., instances of a dataclass with multiple fields, only one of which is the
key to be sorted over), rather than just integer keys. What issues might arise in your random testing approach?
Dataclasses wonâ€™t let you use different subsets of fields for == and <
the field declaration excludes the name field from these comparisons. As a result, Records will be ordered entirely
by their age field.
