What design decisions did you make? What data structures did you use? What functions, classes, and methods did you develop, and what were they for?

Did you accomplish all of your goals? Feel free to include any measurements you did,
example program inputs and outputs, or screenshots. This is also the place to tell us about testing: how did you ensure that your code is correct?
